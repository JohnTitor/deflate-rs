# deflate-rs
An rust implementation of a [DEFLATE](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-deflate.html) encoder. Not a direct port, but does take some inspiration from [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/), [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) and [zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli)(for huffman code length generation).

So far, deflate encoding with and without zlib metadata (no zlib dictionary or gzip support yet) has been is implemented. No unsafe code has been used. Speed-wise it's not quite up to miniz-levels yet.
# Usage:
## Simple compression function:
``` rust
use deflate::deflate_bytes;

let data = b"Some data";
let compressed = deflate_bytes(&data);
```

## Using a writer:

``` rust
use std::io::Write;

use deflate::Compression;
use deflate::write::ZlibEncoder;

let data = b"This is some test data";
let mut encoder = ZlibEncoder::new(Vec::new(), Compression::Default);
encoder.write_all(data).unwrap();
let compressed_data = encoder.finish().unwrap();
```
