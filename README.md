# deflate-rs
An rust implementation of a [DEFLATE](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-deflate.html) encoder. Not a direct port, but does take some inspiration from [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/) and [zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli)(for huffman code length generation).

So far, in-memory deflate encoding with and without zlib metadata (no zlib dictionary or gzip support yet) has been is implemented. No unsafe code has been used. Speed-wise it's not quite up to zlib-levels yet.
# Usage:
```rust
let data = ...;
let compressed = deflate_bytes(&data);
```
