# deflate-rs

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/oyvindln/deflate-rs.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/oyvindln/deflate-rs) [![Crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/deflate.svg)](https://crates.io/crates/deflate) [![Docs](https://docs.rs/deflate/badge.svg)](https://docs.rs/deflate)


An rust implementation of a [DEFLATE](http://www.gzip.org/zlib/rfc-deflate.html) encoder. Not a direct port, but does take some inspiration from [zlib](http://www.zlib.net/), [miniz](https://github.com/richgel999/miniz) and [zopfli](https://github.com/google/zopfli).

So far, deflate encoding with and without zlib metadata (no zlib dictionary or gzip support yet) has been is implemented. No unsafe code has been used. Speed-wise it's not quite up to miniz-levels yet.
# Usage:
## Simple compression function:
``` rust
use deflate::deflate_bytes;

let data = b"Some data";
let compressed = deflate_bytes(&data);
```

## Using a writer:

``` rust
use std::io::Write;

use deflate::Compression;
use deflate::write::ZlibEncoder;

let data = b"This is some test data";
let mut encoder = ZlibEncoder::new(Vec::new(), Compression::Default);
encoder.write_all(data).unwrap();
let compressed_data = encoder.finish().unwrap();
```

* [libflate](https://github.com/sile/libflate) (Not to be confused by libflate in the rust standard library) Another DEFLATE/Zlib/Gzip encoder and decoder written in Rust. (Only does some very light compression).
